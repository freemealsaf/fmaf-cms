Free Meals Appalachia is a 501C3 nonprofit based in Buckhannon, WV. 

Since December 2020, we have been building truly accessible free food resources, using fresh, seasonal, and local ingredients as often as possible.

We collaborate with individuals and organizations to create a diversified and resilient community network that removes financial barriers to meeting human needs.

## What does all this look like in practice?

On the second and fourth Saturdays of each month, we prepare around 200 meals at First Presbyterian Church in Buckhannon, WV. We are not a religious organization, but the church graciously provides space for our food prep and distribution. Volunteers deliver 100-120 of the meals to people who have mobility differences or lack transportation while we offer the rest of the meals for carry out at the church. People can often pick up groceries and clothing items as well. 

Free Meals Appalachia accepts ingredient and supply donations from community members, and community members make these events happen! 

We hope to see you on a Saturday soon.

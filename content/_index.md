Free Meals Appalachia is a 501C3 nonprofit based in Buckhannon, WV. 

Since December 2020, we have been building truly accessible free food resources, using fresh, seasonal, and local ingredients as often as possible.

We collaborate with individuals and organizations to create a diversified and resilient community network that removes financial barriers to meeting human needs.

## What does all this look like in practice?

On the second and fourth Saturdays of each month, we prepare and distribute around 200 meals at the First Presbyterian Church in Buckhannon. We are not a religious organization, but the church graciously provides us with space for our events. Usually around 100-120 of the meals prepared get delivered to people who have mobility differences or lack transportation. We accept ingredient and supply donations from community members, and community members are the ones making these events happen! We hope to see you on a Saturday soon.
